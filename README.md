# PostHog-Rblx
Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.5.1.

An SDK to provide PostHog functionality to Roblox developers.

## Getting Started
If you're currently planning to use it, don't.

To install it, you currently have to Rojo sync the src/PostHog-Rblx folder using [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo).

In the future, you will be able to get a model from the Roblox Toolbox, or use Wally to manage your installation of PostHog-Rblx.

Before you can use this module, you need to:
1. [Create a PostHog Account](https://app.posthog.com/signup)
2. [Create a Project on PostHog](https://posthog.com/docs/settings/projects)
3. Grab your PostHog Project API Key (located in your Project Settings)
4. Add your PostHog Project API Key to your experience's SecretStore in the DevHub. (The default Secret name for the API key is "POSTHOG_API_KEY". This can be changed with the PostHogSettings on Initialization.)
5. Require the PostHog module and call the Enable function.
