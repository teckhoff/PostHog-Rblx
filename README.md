# PostHog-Rblx
Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.5.1.

An SDK to provide PostHog functionality to Roblox developers.

## Getting Started
If you're currently planning to use it, don't, not yet.

To install it, you currently have to Rojo sync the src/PostHog-Rblx folder using [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo).

In the future, you will be able to get a model from the Roblox Toolbox, or use Wally to manage your installation of PostHog-Rblx.

Before you can use this module, you need to:
1. [Create a PostHog Account](https://app.posthog.com/signup)
2. [Create a Project on PostHog](https://posthog.com/docs/settings/projects)
3. Grab your PostHog Project API Key (located in your Project Settings)
4. Require the PostHog module and call the Enable function. Pass in a dictionary containing your API key and any other extraneous options you want to change into the Enable function.

## Currently Functional
* Product Analytics
  * Server-related Events
    * Server Started: When the server starts, generate an ID for it (a UUIDv7 with a prepended 'S-' to signify it as a server).
    * Server Closed: When the server closes, also passes the [CloseReason](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/CloseReason) Enum name into the analytics as a prop.
  * Player-related Events
    * Player Joined: Tracks when a player joins. If the user is not able to be verified to be over 13, they will receive an anonymous ID instead.
    * Player Left: For when the player leaves the game or the server closes.

Every event also has the server ID passed into it as a prop.

## Planned
* Currency-related Analytics (custom currencies, Robux, Gamepasses, Developer Products, [Subscriptions](https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/monetization/subscriptions))
* For non-anonymized users, pass information regarding their locale and current device information (10 ft. display, touch screen, controller, mouse and keyboard, etc) per session into the PlayerJoined event
* Expose the _capture method to allow users of the module to define their own custom events
* Feature Flags, A/B Testing, Surveys
